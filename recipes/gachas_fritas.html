            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a very simple recipe, my mother used to say to me it was eaten after the spanish civil war, 
                where ingredients where poor, therefore even if you think you have <strong>nothing</strong> in the fridge you can still do this recipe. 
                This recipe has a special place in my heart because my mother used to 
                make it for me when I was little. 
            </p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> A glass of Flour</li>
                <li> 6 Garlic</li>
                <li> 4 Ñora</li>
                <li> Olive oil</li>
            </ul>
            <p> The original recipe my mother tought me has Garlic and Ñora as main ingredients
                (Ñora is an spanish pepper), but you can put whatever you like in the dough.
                I recommend you ham and chorizo as a second option.
            </p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Cut in slices the galic and chop the ñora.</li>
                <li> Add a considerable amount of olive oil in a <em>non-sticking</em> pan and fry the galic and ñora</li>
                <li> Remove when golden. Also remove most of the olive oil.</li>
                <li> In the same pan and with some oil left in it add the flour and stir still golden.</li>
                <li> Turn off the stove. Add water slowly and stir to remove the clomps. The result should be like a thick bechamel.</li>
                <li> Add salt.</li>
                <li> Add the galic and ñora to the dough, add also the oil and stir.<0/li>
                <li> Turn on the stove at high heat. Don't stir the mix till its done in one side.</li>
                <li> When ready to flip it, take a plate, place it on top of the pan, and rapidly flip the pan over withe plate on it. Now the dough is on the plate, but it back on the pan so it cooks on the other side.</li>
                <li> When golden brown you are done!</li>
            </ol>
