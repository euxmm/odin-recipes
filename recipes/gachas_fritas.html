            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a very simple recipe, my mother used to say to me it was eaten after the spanish civil war, 
                where ingredients where poor, therefore even if you think you have <strong>nothing</strong> in the fridge you can still do this recipe. 
                This recipe has a special place in my heart because my mother used to 
                make it for me when I was little. 
            </p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Flour</li>
                <li> Garlic</li>
                <li> Ñora</li>
                <li> Olive oil</li>
            </ul>
            <p> The original recipe my mother tought me has Garlic and Ñora as main ingredients
                (Ñora is an spanish pepper), but you can put whatever you like in the dough.
                I recommend you ham and chorizo as a second option.
